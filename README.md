# GRAD-MAP Summer Scholars Code Development Practice

For this exercise, you will write code individually but work in pairs to generate ideas on how to write code for the problem I have below.

I want you to write a Python script which I can import into a Jupyter notebook with the following functionalities:

(1) A function that can create a line plot and save it as a png file. This function should take in two base arguments, x and y arrays.
(2) A function that can create a 1D histogram and save it as a png file. This function should take in one base argument, a 1D array.
(3) A function that prints out a random string of letters. This function should take in one base argument, the length of the string.

Show that the Python script you wrote works by importing it in your Jupyter notebook and using it for any test case you could think of.
